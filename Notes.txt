Objectives of the Mod:

If the player is above 50% Hydration from Hydrate or die-drate They will recieve a benefit.

Why is this good for HoD 
- Players think Hydrate or Diedrate is a lot of negative without a benefit.
- Players want to be incentivised to do the right thing.
- Players want a reward for doing the thing.

Benefits include
- 10% movement speed.
- 10% Hunger Rate reduction.

What we need to identify: 
- How Hydration is stored

EntityBehaviorThirst

    float MaxThirst
    float CurrentThirst
    float hydrationPercent = thirst.CurrentThirst / thirst.MaxThirst; 

    var thirst = entity.GetBehavior<HydrateOrDiedrate.EntityBehaviorThirst>(); 

- How to adjust Hungerrate

    player.Stats.Set("hungerrate", "hydrationMod", hungerMultiplier, true);

- How to Adjust Walkspeed
    
    float walkspeed = entity.Stats.GetBlended("walkspeed");

- How often the Mod should check Hydration



Hydration Source

    Behavior: EntityBehaviorThirst

    Values: CurrentThirst, MaxThirst

    Hydration %:
    hydrationPercent = CurrentThirst / MaxThirst

Hunger Rate

    Stat: "hungerrate"

    Your modifier key: "hydrationMod"

Walk Speed

    Stat: "walkspeed"

    Your modifier key: "hydrationMod"

Gameplay Rule

If hydrationPercent > 50%:

    Walk speed = 10% faster

    Hunger rate = 10% slower

Timing Rule

Every 10 seconds, check hydration and apply the bonuses.
